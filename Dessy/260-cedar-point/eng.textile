Ok, so here is one that happened last year, i was wearing a pink skirt that came a little above my knees, a black tee shirt that has a pink top to it that said "got mercy?" with pink letters.. and yes.. i had pink underwear.. i said it before and i will say it again.. I LOVE THE COLOR PINK lol oh also i had my hair up in a ponytail because i didnt want it cought in anything and it would of looked horrible after 2 rides o.o

There were actully 2 stories in this but one is kind of boring...

So we went to cedar point last year ( me and my frends) and yea.. on the way.. of course i had to go >.> so i had to hold it for about a half hour until we got there and i had to dart for the bathrooms i leaked a tiny bit running to them but i did make (which is why this one was boring..)

It was hot out... and i chugged a big pop at lunch, after lunch we went walking around for maybe 10 minutes, and kinda started needing to go.. but i was really excited and figured i could hold it. we rode like two more rides, then my friends decided to go on the milenium force.. and for anyone who do not know... it is a very big roller coaster..

That really big blue roller coaster on the right is the millenium force...

I didnt want to go on it at all at first (im a little afraid of heights...) but then they talked me into it >.> when we were like halfway through the line i started needing to go bad thow.. so i told my friends that i was going to go to the bathroom and to ride it without me, but they thought i was just trying to chicken out DX

So one of my friends told me "no! you are going to ride this ride Dessy wether you like it or not!" and she grabbed the back of the bottom of my skirt >///> (and before you think anything she did it because she knew that I would not fight back when she could easily just flip my skirt up... yes.. i have a thing with people seeing under my skirt... a BIG thing..)

So when we got toward the top of the stairs i was pretty much dancing... my friend kept telling me to give it up because she wasnt going to fall for it, soe when we got to the top, i dont know why i did this but i did, i looked down over the edge of the rail i freaked myself out and made myself leak a tiny bit because of it (i know smart right?) the line moved faster then i hoped, i kept saying in my head "come on.. break down.. break down.. break down"

I wanted to sit in the back but my friends made me sit in the front car ( nope didnt break down =/)

We got in and dumb*** sat next to me and my 2 other friends sat in the 2 seats behind us. the first thing that ride does is go up a HUGE hill and i dont know if it was because i was scared as heck or because going up a huge hill messes with your bladder but it took everything i had to hold it, and i leaked very tiny bits like 4 or 5 times going up... by the time i got to the top i probaly had a spot bigger then a quarter... and at the top of the hill i was triyng to hold it but since you cant hold yourself it makes it alot harder... i lost it going down the hill, i just lost it...

Amazingly thow.. i still dont really know how this happened... but my skirt did not get wet at all, so i was able to get away without anyone knowing.. thow i think dumb*** knew because he was acting VERY nice the rest of that day and kept fixing my skirt for me o.o
