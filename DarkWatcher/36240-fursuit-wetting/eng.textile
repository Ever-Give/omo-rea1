First please excuse my bad english i’m not a native speaker, and also this is my first ever post in this site, never the less i’ll try to make it as detailed as possible so please enjoy.

So, this happened to me a while back while i was at a convention here where i live, just to make things clear first it wasn’t a furry only convention, but then again it didn’t really stop me, well on with this, so i woke up around 6:45 AM, i had to Wake up early to get everything ready because the whole thing started at 7:30, i got up, put my fursuit on, then i picked up a duffle bag i have for this sort of event and put a spare suit in there, i get in my car and go to the event, the only thing i didn’t do that morning was use the bathroom, mainly because since i love conventions i was so hyped i ended up forgetting about going, well i drive for about 12 minutes till i get there, and the first thing i meet of course, is a line of about 30-40 people, i park my car and get in the line, then after waiting for almost 40 minutes i was inside, at the time i didn’t even feel any urge to pee so i proceeded to look up pannels and go to events and even got to meet some pretty cool people.

Hours later when it was almoust 12:00 PM, at that point i had a bit of an urge but nothing too noticeable, it started to get a bit hot and i was getting really thirsty, i had a watter bottle of 600ml that i emptyed completly before that time, and as i was getting a bit hungry too i decided to have some coke, so i bought two bottles of 400ml each (again i was really thirsty) and downed them both in no time, about two hours later i then started to feel a bit unconfortable as my urge was getting stronger, at that time i was already 30 min. into a pannel so i decided to wait, i would then realize what a mistake that was.

The pannel would last for two more hours, when it was finally over i was bursting, i could barely stop myself from jamming my hands in between my legs, so i rush to the bathroom only to be greeted by another line of 10+ people, i got in line and waited and waited and waited, about halfway through i started fidgeting on my spot and squeezing my legs together, close to the end i had one of my hands firmily gripping my crotch, then a few minutes later i finnally got in.

I quickly got inside one of the stalls and was going to take my suit off when the zíper got stuck, i tried and tried to pull it down but it was futile, and was doing that while i had one of my hands between my legs and both my legs firmily pressing against eachother, i kept trying untill about 5 seconds later i simply froze in place, now with both hands holding my crotch and my legs still pressing against one another, i was doing my best to hold it in but then my bladder simply gave in to the pressure, and i just stood there frozen in place.

As the hot stream of urine forcefully rushed out of my bladder completly soaking my suit running down my legs and forming a big puddle under my feet, as i just stood there trying to process that i was wetting myself in a place full of people, i felt so embarassed that i actually let a couple of tears drop, what was i going to do, how was i supposed to go through the rest of the day with a pee soaked fursuit, but then it hit me, the duffle bag, i had it with me all the time including at that exact moment, so i then opened the stall and looked around, thankfully there was no one else in there, i then got out, picked as many paper towels i could get, wetted them and then i got a some soap, i proceeded to clean myself and change into the spare fursuit i had and put the one that i had just had na accident in inside the duffle bag, i got out of there and quickly gone to my car where i left the bag, got back inside and then enjoyed what was left of the convention.

Yikes! Those are a nightmare to clean! I'm sorry this happened to you!

Thank you for sharing your story. Is the suit okay?

Yeah, fortunately i had that spare one, if i hadn't had it at that time then i would be screwed, and yeah the suit is ok, nothing a bit of elbow grease can't fix, but boy did it take long to get the smell of pee out of it, like, if there's one thing those things do well is get smelly
