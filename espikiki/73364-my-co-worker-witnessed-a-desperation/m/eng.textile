I work in a small grocery store and it’s one of the few places in the area with a public restroom, so we have a fair amount of people coming in looking hurried to use it. You need a key to get in to the restroom and it’s kept behind the registers. So I’ve had my fair share of customers coming in doing a pee dance while asking me for the key.

Today, we had one of those customers, and as luck will have it, I missed it completely as I was focused on a task. But here is what I found out from my coworker:

A young college aged boy up to my coworker who was working in the aisles and asked if we had a public restroom while doing a pee dance. My coworker told him yes but he would need to walk back up to the front and ask for the key. At that point the guy had to stand still for a moment to regain his composure before walking up to the register to get the key.

I finally saw him when he came out of the bathroom and he handed me the key. He walked out quickly after so I didn’t get to see if there was any damage.
